Introduction
------------

This Github project is a new and updated branch of the [Yosemite tree](https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/macosxbootloader/tree/master) and is now targetted at OS X 10.11 El Capitan.


Goals
-----

This project aims to add support for El Capitan (OS X 10.11) for unsupported Mac hardware with a 32-bit only EFI implementation. Like for example the first and second generation Mac Pro models. Though it should work well with any other model with a 32-bit EFI implementation.


Current State
-------------

The current state of this project is: Phase 1, 2 and 3 completed (OS X 10.11 El Capitan is now fully supported).

Note: For more information about the development phases, please visit the [TODO list](https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/macosxbootloader/blob/El-Capitan/TODO.md).


Download
--------

Prebuilt copies of boot.efi can be downloaded from the [project download page](http://piker-alpha.github.io/macosxbootloader/).


Compilation
-----------

Don't want a prebuilt copy of boot.efi then compile the source code yourself, with either Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 or 2015. The latter requires you to update the solution files, but that should be done automatically in the MS Visual Studio IDE.

Note: See also [Compiling-Instructions](https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/macosxbootloader/wiki/Compiling-Instructions)


Thanks To
---------

This project would not have been possible without the help of Peter Holbrook and Mike Boss. Peter did all compiling and Mike ran dozens of test builds that Peter pushed out over at forums.macrumors.com Awesome work guys. Job well done!
